The area of study known as the history of mathematics is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and to a lesser extent an investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past

Before the modern age and the worldwide spread of knowledge written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales The most ancient mathematical texts available are Plimpton  Babylonian c  BC the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus Egyptian c  BC and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus Egyptian c  BC All of these texts mention the socalled Pythagorean triples and so by inference the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry

The study of mathematics as a demonstrative discipline begins in the th century BC with the Pythagoreans who coined the term mathematics from the ancient Greek μάθημα mathema meaning subject of instruction
